# GeorgeAI
# Overview:
GeorgeAI is an AI that considers all possible scenarios and makes the most optimal move in Tic Tac Toe. I introduced a new function called findBestMove(). This function evaluates all the available moves using minimax() and then returns the best move the maximizer can make. To check whether or not the current move is better than the best move i'll take the help of minimax() function which will consider all the possible ways the game can go and returns the best value for that move, assuming the opponent also plays optimally 

The code for the maximizer and minimizer in the minimax() function is similar to findBestMove(), the only difference is instead of returning a move, it will return a value.

Tools Used:
